# Bux Key Generator
This tool generates public and private key pairs for BuxOrg applications. The generated keys are stored in separate files (xpub_key.txt and xprv_key.txt).

## Usage
Run the generator script to generate keys:

`./generator`
The script will create two files:

_xpub_key.txt_: Contains the public key.

_xprv_key.txt_: Contains the private key.
